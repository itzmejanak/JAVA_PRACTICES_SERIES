## 1. Introduction to Arrays

### 1.1 What is an Array?

- Object holding fixed number of values of homogeneous data type.
- Data structure for storing similar elements.
- Length assigned at creation, remains fixed.

#### Elements in Array

- Example: `int a[] = new int[6];`
- Creates array of length 6: `[10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60]`.
- Index starts from 0.

### 1.2 Features of Arrays

- Declared with parentheses `[]` after data type.
- Ordered variables with indexes starting from 0.
- Arrays are objects in Java, occupying memory in 'Heap Area'.
- Direct superclass of array type is Object.
- Created at runtime.
- Length accessed using 'length' member.
- Elements stored in consecutive memory locations.


## 1.3 Advantages of Arrays

- Store multiple data items of the same type using a single name.
- Random access to any element using indexes.
- Used to implement various data structures like linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, and graphs.
- Fast due to avoiding primitive type to wrapper class object conversion.

## 1.4 Disadvantages of Arrays

- Fixed Size: Array size is predetermined and cannot be changed after creation.
- Memory Wastage: Possibility of wasted memory when array size is larger than the number of elements it holds.
- Strongly Typed: Arrays store only elements of the same data type.
- Reduced Performance: Deleting elements requires traversing the entire array, impacting performance.
- No Methods: Arrays lack methods for adding or removing elements.



## 2. Types Of Arrays :
   2.1 Single Dimensional Arrays :-
       1. 1-D Array
   2.2 Multi Dimensional Arrays :-
       2. 2-D Array
       3. 3-D Array

## 3. Array Declaration, Creation and Id Initialisation Initialisation
