ArrayList is an implemented class of the ArrayList-based Data Structure, which is present in the `java.util` package.

1. **ArrayList can store different data types or heterogeneous data**.
2. **ArrayList can store any number of duplicate values**.
3. **ArrayList, present in the `java.util` package, can store values of different data types**.
4. **ArrayList is a class that implements the List interface**.
5. **ArrayList follows the insertion order; items are stored in the order they are added**.
6. **ArrayList does not follow the sorting order**.
7. **ArrayList is created on the basis of a growable or resizable array**.

**Note:** ArrayLists are non-synchronized.

- **Syntax:** Duplicate values are allowed.
- **Constructors:** ArrayList has 11 constructors.
- **Methods:** ArrayList has various methods to manipulate its elements.

## Further Details:
- **Index-based Access:** Elements in an ArrayList can be accessed using their index.
- **Heterogeneous Data:** ArrayList can store a mixture of different data types.
- **Iterable:** ArrayList implements the Iterable interface, allowing for enhanced for-loop iteration.
- **Capacity:** ArrayList dynamically adjusts its capacity as elements are added or removed.
- **Memory Efficiency:** ArrayList can efficiently manage memory allocation for its elements.

## Syntax:
