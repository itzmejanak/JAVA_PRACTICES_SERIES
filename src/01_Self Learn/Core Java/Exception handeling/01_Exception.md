## Understanding Exception Handling in Java

### Daily Routine Process

- **Sleep**
- **Wake Up**
- **Go to Office**
- **Work in Office**

This is our normal flow of daily activities.

### Understanding Exceptions

Imagine suddenly your bus is missed for office, disrupting the normal flow of activities. These unexpected or unwanted events can be considered as exceptions. In programming terms:

- **Exception**: Any event that disrupts the normal flow of the program.
- **Exception Handling**: The process of dealing with such events to ensure the program can continue running smoothly.

If the normal flow is disturbed by such types of events, then it is called an exception.

If we handle these types of events effectively, then it is called exception handling.
